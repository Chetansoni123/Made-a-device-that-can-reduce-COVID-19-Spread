# Made-a-device-that-can-reduce-COVID-19-Spread

A pocket size device, in which if a person come under 2 meter distance with someone, presses a button on this device , which will send the location coordinates of the person with date-time in to the person's own unique database. To access and create database person has to register on this website : https://findloc.herokuapp.com..

The aim of this project is to reduce COVID-19 spread. If in future any COVID-19 patient's location matches with the location database of the person, then person aware about it because he has gone through that address and try to stay healthy as possible and take care of the health.

If everyone has this device especially in containment zone so everyone will be aware to keep minimum 2 meter distance.
